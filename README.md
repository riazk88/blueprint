## Future Enhancements

* I started to create the progress bar but ran into some issues with it's functionality. I was able to display the bar on each question page but was not able to get the bar to track progress after completion of each question. This is something I would like to continue to work on and fix. 

* After answering the last question, the score and submit form pop up on the same page. Instead, I would like for this to display on a separate page.

* The score will always display 100% at the end, showing the client that they have answered all of the questions. Instead, I could like the result to show the client which mental health domains they scored high in and display a link to the next assessment(s) they might need to take based on their scores.

## Technical Choices

I attempted to complete Part 1 and strengthen my backend skills. I used Node.js and was able to build an API. I deployed it onto Heroku. I chose Node.js since this was one of the frameworks I was familiar with from my Coding Bootcamp. For Part 2 I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
